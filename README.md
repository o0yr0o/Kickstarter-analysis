### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Month
![](Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)\
The line graph above shows the number of successful, failed, or cancelled campaigns in the theater category based on their launch month through 2009 to 2017.\
Overall, more theaters have succeeded in meeting their goals, and especially high in May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![](Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)\
The line graph above illustrates information on the percentage of outcomes based on success, failure, and cancellation. Furthermore, the subcategories are limited to plays.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
