# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise would like to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Month
![](Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)\
The line graph above shows the number of successful, failed, or cancelled campaigns in the theater category based on their launch month through 2009 to 2017.\
Overall, more theaters have succeeded in meeting their goals, and especially high in May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![](Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)\
The line graph above illustrates information on the percentage of outcomes based on success, failure, and cancellation. Furthermore, the subcategories are limited to plays.

From the graph we can see that there are no plays has been cancelled. The percentage of successful are higher in the small goal range, and the highest successful rate is in the smallest range of goal. We can also see that there are none of the plays managed to achieve their goals between $45,000 and $49,999. However during the percentage of successful are the same between the range 35,000 to 39,999 and 40,000 to 44,999.

Overall, the percentage of successful is delclining while the range of the goal are increasing.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
